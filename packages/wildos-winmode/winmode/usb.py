"""USB devices handed to Windows (Settings > Windows apps > Windows mode).

A device that only has Windows drivers (a licence dongle, a label printer,
a scanner) goes to Windows live, as a libvirt USB host device, and comes
back when its switch goes off or Windows stops. The choice is remembered
here, per device, not in the domain's definition: a remembered device goes
to Windows whenever Windows runs and it is plugged in, and the definition
never names a device that may not be there at the next start.

Every device this module attaches carries a user alias (ua-wildos-usb-...),
so the live definition itself says which devices are Windows mode's, and
a restart of the service picks up where it was.

Devices are never offered when Wild OS needs them (keyboards, mice and
touchpads, the drive it runs from) and hubs are not shown. A device USB
protection (usbguard) holds back stays held back: it is shown as blocked,
with the same "Allow once" the shield offers, and nothing here changes
usbguard's decision.
