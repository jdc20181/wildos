#!/bin/bash
# Fills the rebuild cache with the patched Debian packages Wild OS already
# publishes, so a build takes them instead of compiling them. CI starts with
# an empty cache, and LibreOffice alone compiles for longer than a CI job may
# run. build-iso.sh runs this in the builder when WILDOS_REBUILDS_FROM is set
# (CI), or on its own with --fetch-rebuilds.
#
#   /src       the checkout, read-only
#   /rebuilds  the rebuild cache build.sh reads (build-iso.sh mounts it)
#
# Nothing here lists the rebuilds. Each one is found in build/build.sh by its
# cache line, cached="$REBUILDS/<dir>/$version$(wildos_suffix <name>)-$stamp",
# and the lines of its block down to that one run unchanged, so the cache
# entry filled is exactly the one build.sh then looks for. A rebuild added to
# build.sh in the same shape is fetched without changing this script.
#
# A published copy is used only when it is the same build:
#   - its version is exactly Debian's current version plus the +wildosN
#     build.sh would give it, and
#   - the stamp hashes nothing but build/patches/<name>, the folder whose
#     commits N counts. Published packages come from main, so on main a given
#     N is a given set of patches, and the same version means the same stamp.
#     A rebuild whose stamp covers anything else (evolution-data-server's
#     comes from its recipe in build.sh) can change without its version
#     changing, so it is compiled.
# Anything else is compiled by build.sh as before, and said so loudly.
#
# Every file is checked before it is used: InRelease against the update
# signing key in wildos-base, Packages against the SHA256 in the signed
# release, and each .deb against the SHA256 and size in Packages. A failed
# check stops the build rather than compile around it.
#
# WILDOS_REBUILDS_FROM   the repository (https://deb.wildos.io)
# WILDOS_REBUILDS_PRUNE  1 removes cache entries this checkout doesn't use
#                        (CI's own cache folder only, never the shared one)
